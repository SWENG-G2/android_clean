    <![CDATA[
Penelope was founded in the UK at the University of York in 2022 by a group of students who were passionate about creating high-quality android applications. They started the organisation from the ground up, focusing on building a team that was dedicated to innovation, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. Today, Penelope is a thriving company that continues to embody these values. We believe that effective project management is crucial to our success, and we use a variety of strategies to facilitate innovation and communication in the work environment. Our goal is to provide our customers with a product that is not only functional but also visually appealing and easy to use. We also strive to create a work environment where our employees can grow and develop their skills, and where they feel proud to be part of our team.

Our current ongoing goal has been the development and sale an educational Android application to provide students of campus-based universities, and local members of the public, a means of identifying and learning about the local wildlife. By providing potential future students with information on the wildlife that exists on campus, we are giving them the opportunity to fall in love with the university even prior to beginning their studies.
